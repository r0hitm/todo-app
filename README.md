# ToDo App

This project is a ToDo App originally inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list). It was initially created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, this version of the project has been enhanced with TypeScript and React. Instead of using Webpack, Vite is utilized as the bundler.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a practical learning experience. By incorporating TypeScript and Firebase, the project aims to explore new technologies for user authentication and data storage.

Notable features and learning points of this project include:

- Implementation of ES6 modules and classes.
- Utilization of Vite as the bundling tool.
- Implementation of React for the UI. (new)
- Integration of TypeScript for code reliability and maintainability. (new)
- Incorporation of Firebase for user authentication and data storage. (new)
