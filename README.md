# ToDo App

This project is a ToDo App originally inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list). It was initially created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, this version of the project has been enhanced with TypeScript and React. Instead of using Webpack, Vite is utilized as the bundler, and testing is done with vitest.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a practical learning experience. This is not intended to be a production-ready application.

Notable features and learning points of this project include:

<<<<<<< HEAD
